The memory card project is an assignment for The Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card
Users try and click on pokemon without repeating. Every time the user clicks on a card, the cards are shuffled. High scores are tracked over the session.

## Getting Started
```
https://github.com/singhalex/cv-application.git
cd memory-card
npm install
npm start
```

## How it Works
The images and card info are fetched from the Pok√©Api. The info is collected in an array and shuffled on page load through useEffect. The cards are then built off of the array. When the user clicks on a card, they are shuffled and the id of the card is kept track of in an array. This array is checked every click to and if a guess is duplicated, the game ends and a high score is set if achieved.
